Test [SwiftCoreMLTools](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/SwiftCoreMLTools) library exporting to CoreML a real Swift for TensorFlow Regression model trained on the [Boston housing price dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/).

This repo contains:

- The S4TF training notebook exporting to CoreML with the SwiftCoreMLTools swift library
- A TensorfFlow 1.x training notebook exporting to CoreML with the CoreMLTools python library
- A TensorfFlow 2.x training notebook exporting to CoreML with the tfcoreml python library
- Xcode playgrounds to test inferencing the exported CoreML models
